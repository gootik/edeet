Using Erlang, Websockets, and [MediumEditor](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor) to build a Google docs 
like online editor that let's people collaborate and edit documents
at the same time.

Why
------
 1. Couldn't find anything that looked half decent and did what I wanted it to do.
 2. Learning websockets and some frontend programming.
 3. Bored.
 
Warning
---------
Code is not of the highest quality. This is currently an on-going project that was
 started on a boring weekend day.
